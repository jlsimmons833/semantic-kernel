In response to your question about how Camus' philosophy relates to Indian philosophies and texts, it is important to note that Indian philosophies and texts have a rich tradition of exploring the concept of dharma, which can be understood as one's duty or purpose in life. While Camus argues that life has no inherent meaning, Indian philosophies and texts suggest that individuals can find meaning and purpose through fulfilling their dharma. This concept of dharma can be seen as a way to reconcile Camus' philosophy with Indian philosophies and texts. Additionally, the concept of karma, which suggests that one's actions have consequences, can be seen as a way to understand Camus' idea of the absurd, where individuals must create their own meaning in a world that is inherently meaningless.",
